# Contact Information Extractor

This Python script extracts phone numbers, email addresses, and websites from a text file and saves them to separate files. It uses regular expressions to identify patterns in the text and ensures that only unique entries are saved.

## Features

- **Extract Email Addresses:** Identifies email addresses ending with `.com`, `.net`, or `.org`.
- **Extract Websites:** Identifies websites ending with `.com`, `.net`, or `.org`.
- **Save to Files:** Saves unique phone numbers to `phone_numbers.txt`, emails to `emails.txt`, and websites to `websites.txt`.
